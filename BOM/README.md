## Bill Of Materials
The components for this project are designed to be flexible. 

The `BHR-20-HUA` is the cheapest IDC header I found on Digikey at the time of writing this. It can be replaced with any IDC header or standard 0.1" pitch header. A right able connector is need to have the header accessible to the PCI bracket.

The `MIC2876-5.0YMT-TR` boost converter used can be swapped for any fixed output varitants of the MIC2876 or MIC2875 boost converters. If the 5V output is not need then the boost converter and supporting passives should not be installed. The 5V pins can swaped to GND by not installing the boost converter and bridging the pins of C1, for example with an 0805 0Î© resistor. 

A Bill of Materials with links to the parts on Digikey can be found in the excel sheet in this folder.
