## 3D Printing Instructions
After printing both brackets its not advised to 3D print the brackets. The thin nature of the brackets and number of overhangs makes it hard to get a clean bracket. The low profile bracket was somewhat easier to print compared to the full profile bracket. I will be making a 3D printed Jig so that users can cut out the right area from a blank metal bracket.
